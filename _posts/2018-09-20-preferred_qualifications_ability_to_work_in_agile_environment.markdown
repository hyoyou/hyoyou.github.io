While looking through job postings, I noticed that a lot of companies would put "Agile Software Development" in the "Bonus Points" or "Nice to Have" sections, and naturally, I started wondering what this was.

"Agile", is neither a programming language nor an environment, but an approach to project management, which is now utilized in software development. It is a set of methods and practices that follow the values set forth in the Agile Manifesto, which I will get to soon. The process consists of iterative sequences, commonly referred to as "sprints", to reach a working product quickly while maintaining focus by breaking down larger tasks into smaller ones. It involves constant unit testing at the end of each iteration and quickly adapts when the client or stakeholders desire change.

There are a number of different methodologies and frameworks that adapt to the Agile Software Development, such as Kanban, eXtreme Programming (XP), Lean, and Scrum.

In 2001, 17 developers met together to publish the [Manifesto for Agile Software Development](http://agilemanifesto.org/), which outlines how this approach values people working effectively, having a working product over documentation, and the nature of a project changing its course as the project moves along further and the need for those involved to be able to embrace these changes.

> We are uncovering better ways of developing
software by doing it and helping others do it.
Through this work we have come to value:

> **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools
> 
> **Working software** over comprehensive documentation
> 
> **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation
> 
> **Responding to change** over following a plan

> That is, while there is value in the items on
the right, we value the items on the left more.

This manifesto is based on the [12 principles](http://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html) below:

1. Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
2. Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for 
3. the customer's competitive advantage.
4. Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.
5. Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.
6. Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.
7. The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.
8. Working software is the primary measure of progress.
9. Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.
10. Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.
11. Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount of work not done--is essential.
12. The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.
1. At regular intervals, the team reflects on how 
to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts 
its behavior accordingly.

## Scrum
Scrum is an Agile framework with a very specific set of practices as described in the [Scrum Guide](https://www.scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html).

The Scrum Team consists the Product Owner, Scrum Master, and the dev team. 
* The **Product Owner** is responsible for the business side of product development and acts as the liason between the stakeholders and the dev team. The product owner needs to be a strong communicator, with empathy to put one's self in another's shoes. The Product Owner represents the final user's best interest, and the entire organization must respect the decisions made by the Product Owner. The Product Owner is also responsible for maintaining the Product Backlog, "an ordered list of everything that is known to be needed in the product. It is the single source of requirements for any changes to be made to the product."

* The **Scrum Master** is responsible for facilitating scrum and making sure delivery of product goals are not hindered, and the role has sometimes been referred to as "team facilitator". Some of the core responsibilities include promoting self-organization and cross functionality within the team, helping employees and stakeholders understand and enact Scrum product development, and ensuring the Daily Scrum (meetings).

* The **Development Team** is responsible for delivering the working products at the end of each iterations, referred to as "Sprints", ranging from 2-4 weeks. The dev team is self-organizing, meaning no one outside the team provides directions or how to deliver the product, and cross-functional, meaning the product does not depend on work done by anyone outside the team.

The optimal scrum team is about 7 people, and must remain small enough to complete the given work in a Sprint. The Scrum Guide suggests a team consisting of more than 9 members will require too much coordination. 

Sprints have consistent durations throughout development, and consists of Sprint Planning, Daily Scrums, Sprint Review, and Sprint Retrospective.

Spring Planning is the plan created through the collaboration of the entire Scrum Team. It answers what can be delivered in the duration of the Sprint, amd how the work will be done throughout the sprint.

The Daily Scrum/Standup Meeting, which can be shorter but at the maximum 15 minutes per day, is a meeting for the dev team to cover: 
1. What they did yesterday
2. What they will do today
3. Is there anything blocking your task from being done?

The meeting occurs at the same time, every day, and the entire team must be there. These meetings value sustainability and transparency through daily collaborations and conversations.

The Sprint Review is the meeting held at the end of the Sprint to review what has been "Done" during this Sprint, and what remains in the Product Backlog. The team also discusses what went well, and what to do next. It is a collaborative meeting held with the dev team as well as key stakeholders.

The Sprint Retrospective is a meeting held after the Sprint is over and before the next Sprint begins. This meeting allows for the Scrum Team to reflect on how the Sprint went, and what could have been done to improve, or also identify what went well. The Scrum Master is present to ensure that the meeting is positive.

There has been criticism of this methodology, saying developers face burnout due to the high pressure of shorter deadlines, although the purpose is to break down large projects into smaller goals and deliverables. Doing just enough, in enough time is the goal of the Scrum Team. Fail fast, is another motto, and they believe that failure is okay, but quicker feedback also allows for faster learning.
