I am almost reaching my two month mark since starting the full-stack web development course. I hoped to be further along in my course, since I reduced hours at work so that I could dedicate more hours to learning. However, April has been a very exhausting month at work, and with the material getting harder, I've been allowing myself to make excuses (all the while hating myself for doing that). I was stuck on the Hashes Manipulation Lab for so long, that I found myself just trying writing any code to get the test to pass instead of trying to figure out logically what I need to do to get my code to work. I was really burnt out by the time that lab finally passed. There are some labs that I've passed, but I'm afraid that if I go back and try to solve them again at a later date, I may not pass it the first time around.

I want to remind myself that the most important thing is that I understand the material as I move along, and my success is not going to be measured by how quickly I pass this course!
