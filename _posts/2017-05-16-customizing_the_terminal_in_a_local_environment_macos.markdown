title:  Customizing the Terminal in a Local Environment (macOS)

I was having some problems with Learn IDE about a week or two ago and decided to take the plunge and switch over to a local environment. It was scary and took me hours to get everything installed and figured out, but I'm proud to have been using it without any issues so far :)

I am using Atom, so the interface is not much different from Learn IDE. However, as I was getting used to the terminal, I found I was really unhappy (bored!) with the appearance. It was just black text on a plain white background.

See what I mean?



#### Some simple steps to make the terminal more attractive:

Head over to the Menu Bar, navigate to Terminal > Preferences > Profiles Tab

We can play around with the background color, or even add our own image.
We can change the font type and size, as well as colors. If you check off "Use bold fonts", "Display ANSI colors", and "Use bright colors for bold text", it will make things like directories and executables easier to find and read.

If you truly want to customize your terminal with your favorite colors and background image, this is the way to go.

However, if it were up to me to customize and I just chose all my favorite colors, my terminal would be pretty difficult to look at!

So I searched and found a theme that I liked and imported it into my terminal.
There are many talented developers who posted beautiful themes on their own websites or on their GitHub pages.
Two of my favorites are [Dracula](https://draculatheme.com/terminal/) and [SMYCK](http://color.smyck.org/).

Installation was very simple. I downloaded the compressed file, unzipped, and went back into the Preferences on the Terminal Menu Bar. On the left side is a list of themes, and on the bottom you can find a "Gear" icon > Import > Find the unzipped file and look for the file ending with .terminal. That's it! The theme should show up with your list of default themes, double-click to open a new terminal window with the new theme. If you're happy with it, don't forget to click Default!

Here is my current terminal with the SMYCK theme.

It's a whole lot more interesting than the default terminal and improved my command line experience making output much easier to read!
