    <p>Hello! I'm Heather!</p>
    <p>Ever since I was little, I found joy in building things (sometimes breaking and rebuilding&mdash; a cycle of trial and error) and was fascinated about how things work. On one Christmas, maybe when I was four or five years old, I received a dollhouse, and the bulk of my time was spent pulling apart and reconstructing the dollhouse rather than roleplaying with the dolls within the dollhouse. I still remember what that dollhouse looked like but can't recall what the dolls looked like at all!</p>
    <p>My first experience with coding was back in 2003, when Xanga was the popular social networking site. Because the preset themes were limited and I didn't want my page looking like everyone else's, I wanted to explore other options to customize and make my page reflect me a little better. That's when I first started playing around with HTML. There weren't that many tutorials like the ones we have today, but I learned what I could and ultimately had friends, and even friends of friends, handing over their passwords and asking me to customize their Xanga pages! Little did I know that this would be my start to programming!</p>
    <p>I had big dreams of becoming an architect and was diligently preparing my portfolio to apply to college, until one internship, the summer before my senior year, made me realize maybe architecture was not for me. It was not a good time to be lost, with college application season around the corner, so I went into pre-pharmacy school with little enthusiasm. Three semesters into college, I realized I loved and looked forward to my biology laboratory classes. I loved experimenting and analyzing the results of the logs! Once again, I was excited and welcomed the challenges of trial and error and graduated with a degree in biological sciences.</p>
    <p>Fast forward to 2017, I had held a few different roles in different industries, and found that I could not satisfy my yearning to be creative. That's when I decided to apply to Flatiron School. Web programming helps me find that balance between problem solving and being creative. I am so excited and looking forward to the amazing web apps I'll be building!</p>
